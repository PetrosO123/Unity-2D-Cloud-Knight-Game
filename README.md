# Unity-2D-Cloud-Knight-Game
I developed a platformer video game in Unity 2D utilizing the C# programming language. A few sprites from online packs that fell under Creative Commons 0 licensing were used. The interactions between the playable knight character and the objects in that player's environment, the animations for the knight character, as well as the assembly of the pieces of the knight from the pack's sprite sheet were all done manually.
