# Unity-2D-Cloud-Knight-Game
I developed a platformer video game in Unity 2D using the C# programming language. A few sprites from online packs that fell under Creative Commons 0 licensing were used, and the animations for the playable knight character, as well as the assembly of the pieces of the knight from the pack's sprite sheet were assembled together manually.
