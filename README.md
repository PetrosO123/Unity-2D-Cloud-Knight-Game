# Unity-2D-Cloud-Knight-Game
I developed a platformer video game in Unity 2D using C#. A few sprites from online packs that fell under Creative Commons 0 licensing were used, and the interactions between the playable knight character and the objects in the player's environment, the animations for the knight, as well as the assembly of the pieces of the knight's structure were all done manually.
